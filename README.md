MechSlayers is a role playing game based on [DungeonSlayers](http://www.dungeonslayers.net/) playing in the BattleTech universe.

This project is not trying to reinvent the wheel - we will grab and rearrange existing rules from [StarSlayers](http://starslayers.de) and [GammaSlayers](www.gammaslayers.de).

We also do NOT aim to define new rules for the table top game. Just fight with your Mechs following the original rules.

All idea will first be collected in issues. In a second step docs will be written and https://mechslayers.github.io/ will be generated.
